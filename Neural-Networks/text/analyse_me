I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. 
I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. 
This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. 
While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance 
to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. 
Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly 
brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout. When this film was over the place was blown away and every audience member 
was awestruck that they witnessed a film that could still transport them into a character's world and very existence. 
Believe the hype. This is going to be revered as a transcending masterpiece of cinema.
